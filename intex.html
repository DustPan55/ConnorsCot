        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>          
            Dear Friends,
            <br><br>
            I come to you today with a heartfelt mission: to establish "Connor’s Cot," a foundation born out of love and loss, dedicated to supporting families in their darkest hours. In our journey of preparing for the arrival of our precious son, Connor, who will grace us with his presence on July 22nd, we have become intimately aware of the profound impact that a Cuddle Cot can have on families facing the unimaginable loss of a newborn. These remarkable devices, available in some hospitals, provide families with the invaluable gift of time to grieve with their baby at home.
            <br><br>
            Tragically, Fayette County lacks access to this vital resource. With just 46 days remaining until Connor's arrival, we are steadfast in our resolve to change this reality. The cost of a Cuddle Cot stands at approximately $3,000, a barrier that many families cannot overcome during their time of need.
            <br><br>
            Our dream is to raise $3,000 to procure a Cuddle Cot for our dear Connor. Yet, our vision extends beyond our own family; we aspire to ensure that families in Fayette County, who may find themselves walking a similar path, have access to the solace and support that a Cuddle Cot provides.
            <br><br>
            Together, let us honor Connor's legacy by extending comfort and compassion to those who need it most.
            <br><br>
            With heartfelt gratitude,
            <br>
            The Wangerin Family
        </p>
